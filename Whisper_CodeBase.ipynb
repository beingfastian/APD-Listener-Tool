            "Welcome to YesKid Educational Channel. Hello. Hi, Lisa. Hi, Ruby. What happened? I'm trying to call you since forever. Where were you? I'm sorry. I didn't notice your call. What happened, Lisa? Is anything wrong? Why do you sound so worried? It's nothing. Come on, Lisa. I'm your friend. Tell me. I'm just a bit worried about my future. Basically, I'm completely confused. Oh, Lisa, no need to worry now. You are in class 10. So what, Ruby? After one year I have to sit for my board exams and after that I have to pick a stream for higher studies. But you are so good in English. You should choose literature, in my opinion. I know, Ruby. Even I also want to study literature. Well, then everything is completely fine. You have already decided it. That is the problem. The decision does not depend entirely on me. Are you talking about your parents? Yes. But parents are always concerned about their child's future. That is totally normal. But my parents want me to study medical science. But I am quite aware that you hate biology. Then how will you pursue medical science in the future? I have no idea. I am too confused. Then try to convince your parents. Try to make them understand. Believe me, I've tried a lot. I couldn't convince them. What are they saying? That I would get a lot of career options if I choose science. There are a lot more opportunities in science than any other stream. Think for once. Maybe they are actually right. Then what am I supposed to do now? Do not worry. You still have one whole year in your hand. And even after that, if you still think that you would face problems if you take science, then I would talk to uncle and aunt. Do not worry. I'm sure they will try to understand your situation. Let's see. Why are you worrying so much? I'll always stay by your side. I know Ruby. I'm really lucky to get a friend like you. Anyways tell me about you. What are your parents saying? I'm quite lucky. I don't have this pressure over me. Then you can choose the subject that you like. Hum. But of course I have to consult my parents before taking any decision. Because they are much more experienced than us, you know. But I believe that they'll never put any pressure on me. Really? You're too lucky. I think all the parents should be like this. That means you will take science after class 10, right? Yeah, that's for sure. You know how much I love biology. I love physics as well. Chemistry is good too. And I need to work a little bit on maths. It is quite hard. That's not a big deal at all. Right anyways, listen. The reason I called you is because I want to tell you something. What do you want to say? You have to come to my house next Sunday. Why? Next Sunday is my birthday, Lisa. Oh, I'm so sorry. How could I forget? Anyways, my mom is going to call your parents anytime soon. But I'm still inviting you here. Remember, you have to come, okay? Of course, I'll come. Happy birthday in advance.
